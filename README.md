A Notebook-keeping Winforms (C#) application which creates and maintains Notebook objects which contain Entry objects.
Entry objects can be tagged with a robust system of Labels. Notebooks can be searched by entry text and title, labels, and created on or edited on dates.
The application synchs with Azure data as of Jan. '23.
