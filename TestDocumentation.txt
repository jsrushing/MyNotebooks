		06/29/23 0008 - Rename should have a way to select from the labels list. User can 'search' using frmLabelsManager lstLabels_Click, then rename a label in any found notebook, then click another label and rename labels in that notebook to the same as the 1st operation.
		BUG !! >> Currently renaming with an existing label name creates two labels with same name.
